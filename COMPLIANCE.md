# **AGPLv3 Compliance for Q-QAL**

We have designed **Q-QAL** as **open-source software** for the benefit of the open-source community. This means that organizations and developers using **Q-QAL** must carefully consider whether their usage complies with the terms of the **GNU AGPLv3** license.

**QUEL Imaging, LLC** cannot provide legal advice or make determinations regarding whether your use of **Q-QAL** is in compliance with AGPLv3 license obligations. To ensure compliance, we strongly recommend consulting with **your legal counsel** or a qualified licensing specialist. They can help you understand the nuances of the AGPLv3 and how it applies to your specific use case, including any other open-source software your application may interact with.

We understand that **AGPLv3 licensing** can be complex, especially in scenarios involving network-based services and software distribution. It is crucial to rely on expert advice rather than unofficial sources or anecdotal interpretations of licensing rules.

### **Commercial Licensing Option**

If your use of **Q-QAL** triggers AGPLv3 obligations (e.g., the requirement to open-source your own application when using Q-QAL), we offer **commercial licenses** through  **QUEL Imaging** . A commercial license provides greater flexibility, ensuring that you can use Q-QAL without the need to release your own code under an open-source license. For more information please [contact us](https://shop.quelimaging.com/resources/#contact).

Using **Q-QAL** – or any other AGPL-licensed code – without validating your compliance with licensing obligations  **is done at your own risk** . Please ensure that all use cases are fully vetted by qualified experts to avoid potential legal or compliance issues.
